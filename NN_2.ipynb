            "0     Tracking two lost lumberjacks through the night, a rescue team nearly follows a hound over a cliff. Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, killed by a unknown thing. The third is then, killed by a unseen force Dr. Robert Verne  is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \"Opies\" , the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso , one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident. While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested. The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai , Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \"part of everything in God's creation\". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue. Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast spanks him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon , refuses to take off in the high wind. They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning: she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives. Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs. Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him. The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit. They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death. Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water. Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror.\n",

            "4995  Max  is a plumber working in the apartment building complex into which anthropologist Jill Cowper  and her husband doctor Brian  have recently moved. Max appears uninvited at the Cowper apartment claiming their plumbing needs repair, even though the couple has noticed no irregularities. Convincing them that the problems with their plumbing are not easily noticed, he begins work in their bathroom by dismantling some pipes. Max's work on the bathroom drags on for days and it becomes increasingly obvious that he is only doing more damage by tearing out walls and pipes and rendering the bathroom useless. Over time, Max begins to frighten Jill by taking the liberty to use their shower without permission and playing guitar and singing songs in the bathroom while he was supposed to be working. He also makes his way into the apartment through the roof when the door is not opened for him. The damage he caused to the bathroom eventually leads to a serious injury to a house guest who happens to be an official from the World Health Organization. The Cowpers are able to rectify the situation but Max, a self-declared \"rock-and-roll rebel\", is unrelenting.

            "4996  Grimm, dressed as a clown, robs a bank in midtown Manhattan. He ingeniously sets up a hostage situation and then slips away with an enormous sum of money and his accomplices: girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis. The heist itself is comparatively straightforward and easy, but the getaway turns into a nightmare. The relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight out of the city is complicated by the fact that fate, luck and all of New York City appears to be conspiring against their escape. For starters, the trio is seeking the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to get the airport, but the signs were taken during construction work, resulting in the three robbers becoming lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. Then, a con-artist/thief robs the trio of everything they have . When changing into new clothes, they are almost gunned down by the stressed incoming tenant of Phyllis' apartment, as members of the fire department respond to a call by pushing their hydrant-blocking car out of the way only to make it roll into a ditch. When the three crooks eventually manage to flag down a cab, the driver is hopelessly non-fluent in English. This leads Loomis to jumping out of the moving cab to grab another, but he runs into a newsstand and the driver leaves, thinking he's killed Loomis. An anal-retentive bus driver, a run-in with mobsters and Phyllis' increasing desperation to tell Grimm the news that she is pregnant with his child add further complications. All the while, Rotzinger, a world-weary but relentless chief of the New York City Police Department, is doggedly attempting to nab the fleeing trio. A final confrontation on board an airliner at the airport occurs between the robbers and the chief, who gets the added prize of having a major crime-boss dropped in his lap.

            "4998  It stars Joe Shishido as a hitman who, along with his sidekick played by Jerry Fujio, is hired by the yakuza to eliminate a rival gang's boss. The two are captured after the job, escape and are waylaid once again resulting in a climatic battle. The film was among Shishido's first starring roles, cementing him as a hardboiled action hero, and remains a personal favourite of the 170 films he made at Nikkatsu.<ref name  Schilling | first  No

            "4999  Jamal and Enayatullah are Afghan refugees in a camp in Peshawar, Pakistan. They travel to Quetta, and thence to Taftan on the Iranian border. They pay people smugglers to assist them over the border; on their first attempt they are stopped by Iranian police and returned to Pakistan, but their second attempt is successful. They travel to Tehran and then to Maku, in the Kurdish part of Iran, from where they cross a mountain range on foot to Turkey. In Istanbul they meet a group of other migrants, and they are taken to Italy inside a shipping container. The container is not ventilated, and most of the refugees, including Enayatullah, are suffocated to death. Jamal survives and lives in Italy for a time. He then steals a woman's purse and buys a rail ticket to Paris. From there, he goes to the Sangatte asylum seekers camp and with a new friend, Yusef, he crosses the channel by stowing away on a lorry. Finally, he arrives in London, where he calls his uncle to say he has arrived but that Enyatullah is \"not in this world\". The film ends with images of the Peshawar refugees.

The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, killed by a unknown thing. The third is then, killed by a unseen force Dr. Robert Verne  is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \"Opies\" , the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso , one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident. While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested. The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai , Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \"part of everything in God's creation\". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue. Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast spanks him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon , refuses to take off in the high wind. They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning: she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives. Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs. Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him. The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit. They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death. Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water. Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror.</td>\n",

Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity As they leave however Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggies boots It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap It will not show up in Iselys water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies That night the Nelson family who have set up a camp in the woods are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster The horrified Paul tries to flee but the beast spanks him into a rock killing him The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family Hawks however escapes Verne Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poachers net One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination However the weather has turned and the pilot Huntoon  refuses to take off in the high wind They make for Hectors home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hectors tepees and helps the cub survive Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub Isely is contrite knowing that Hawks and his men werent the killers Hector arrives Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hectors home All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him The next day the survivors make their way out of the forest The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beasts initial attack Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help Katahdin kills him as well The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit They arrive at the river and swim across The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges They take shelter in a log cabin but Katahdin tears down the walls Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead Verne picks up an arrow then Katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror</td>\n",

              "0  Tracking two lost lumberjacks through the night, a rescue team nearly follows a hound over a cliff. Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, killed by a unknown thing. The third is then, killed by a unseen force Dr. Robert Verne  is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \"Opies\" , the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso , one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident. While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested. The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai , Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \"part of everything in God's creation\". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue. Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast spanks him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon , refuses to take off in the high wind. They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning: she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives. Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs. Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him. The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit. They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death. Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water. Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror.  ...

beasts initial attack Isely heads up to Mount to try to reach a radio tower and call for help Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help Katahdin kills him as well The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit They arrive at the river and swim across The cub continues to bite but pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges They take shelter in a log cabin but Katahdin tears down the walls is knocked unconscious by debris but is crushed to death finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead picks up an arrow then Katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water and fly over the forest the next day but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror\n",

              "2  Dey plays Valerie Smith, a 17-year-old who is lured into participating in a robbery. Captured by the authorities, she is sent to a reformatory, where she finds herself in more and more trouble while trying to adjust. Her sentence multiplied, it appears Valerie may never leave state custody. Valerie becomes the target of unwanted sexual advances from some of the other inmates, until a young African-American lesbian named Tommy  takes her under her protection. Tommy ultimately sacrifices her life to save Valerie's.

              "3  Dr. David Lowell's  research is carried out in the canyon country of southern Utah and must be conducted at the same time Halley's Comet is passing over the earth.

He spends the rest of the film committing ecotage against the company and trying to recover his land.

camp in the woods are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster The horrified tries to flee but the beast spanks him into a rock killing him The next day as and are taking blood samples Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the family Hawks however escapes and take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings and find huge scratch marks on the trees while finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poachers net One of the cubs is still alive and is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination However the weather has turned and the pilot Huntoon refuses to take off in the high wind They make for Hectors home and sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff sets up an emergency room in one of Hectors tepees and helps the cub survive is clearly distressed by the ordeal so takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub Isely is contrite knowing that Hawks and his men werent the killers arrives Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hectors home All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him The next day the survivors make their way out of the forest The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beasts initial attack Isely heads up to Mount to try to reach a radio tower and call for help Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help Katahdin kills him as well The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit They arrive at the river and swim across The cub continues to bite but pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges They take shelter in a log cabin but Katahdin tears down the walls is knocked unconscious by debris but is crushed to death finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead picks up an arrow then Katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water and fly over the forest the next day but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror</td>\n",

sheriff sets up an emergency room in one of hectors tepees and helps the cub survive is clearly distressed by the ordeal so takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon she tells him that their nightmare is just beginning she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs isely and sheriff pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub isely is contrite knowing that hawks and his men werent the killers arrives then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath hectors home all goes quiet so pilgrim decides to check it out he pokes his head up out of the tunnel and katahdin kills him the next day the survivors make their way out of the forest the helicopter is not an option as huntoon was severely mauled in the beasts initial attack isely heads up to mount to try to reach a radio tower and call for help isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before isley is able to call help katahdin kills him as well the others find the opie village mysteriously isolated and the opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road katahdin turns the truck over and finishes huntoon off by devouring his head the others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit they arrive at the river and swim across the cub continues to bite but pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it stays behind to make katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes they believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges they take shelter in a log cabin but katahdin tears down the walls is knocked unconscious by debris but is crushed to death finds a winchester model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect hawks shoots arrows into katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead picks up an arrow then katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water and fly over the forest the next day but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror</td>\n",

set against having children When they fly in they meet a man and his two children and who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness They also meet Bethel Isely the director of the paper mill who is to be their host He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies The latter have their own explanation Katahdin a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers Isely describes Katahdin as larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat As Isely drives the couple to their cabin their path is barred by a party of Opies They refuse to let Iselys people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies Hawks and Kelso one of Iselys heavies The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe The

is cheap It will not show up in Iselys water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies That night the family who have set up a camp in the woods are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster The horrified tries to flee but the beast spanks him into a rock killing him The next day as and are taking blood samples Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the family Hawks however escapes and take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings and find huge scratch marks on the trees while finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poachers net One of the cubs is still alive and is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination However the weather has turned and the pilot Huntoon refuses to take off in the high wind They make for Hectors home and sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff sets up an emergency room in one of Hectors tepees and helps the cub survive is clearly distressed by the ordeal so takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon She tells him

him and before Isley is able to call help Katahdin kills him as well The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the

to be their host he tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the opies the latter have their own explanation katahdin a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers isely describes katahdin as larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat as isely drives the couple to their cabin their path is barred by a party of opies they refuse to let iselys people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the opies hawks and kelso one of iselys heavies the heavy is armed with a chainsaw while hawks has only a broadaxe the

sheriff pilgrim arrive to arrest hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the family hawks however escapes and take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings and find huge scratch marks on the trees while finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poachers net one of the cubs is still alive and is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination however the weather has turned and the pilot huntoon refuses to take off in the high wind they make for hectors home and sends hawks to fetch isely and the sheriff sets up an emergency room in one of hectors tepees and helps the cub survive is clearly distressed by the ordeal so takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon she tells him

him and before isley is able to call help katahdin kills him as well the others find the opie village mysteriously isolated and the opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road katahdin turns the truck over and finishes huntoon off by devouring his head the others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit they arrive at the river and swim across the cub continues to bite but pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it stays behind to make katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes they believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges they take shelter in a log cabin but katahdin tears down the walls is knocked unconscious by debris but is crushed to death finds a winchester model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect hawks shoots arrows into katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead picks up an arrow then katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water and fly over the forest the next day but the final scene

him and before isley is able to call help katahdin kills him as well the others find the opie village mysteriously isolated and the opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road katahdin turns the truck over and finishes huntoon off by devouring his head the others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit they arrive at the river and swim across the cub continues to bite but pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it stays behind to make katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes they believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges they take shelter in a log cabin but katahdin tears down the walls is knocked unconscious by debris but is crushed to death finds a winchester model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect hawks shoots arrows into katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead picks up an arrow then katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake notices

The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, killed by a unknown thing. The third is then, killed by a unseen force Dr. Robert Verne  is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \"Opies\" , the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso , one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident. While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested. The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai , Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \"part of everything in God's creation\". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue. Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast spanks him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon , refuses to take off in the high wind. They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning: she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives. Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs. Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him. The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit. They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death. Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water. Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror.</td>\n",

Androscoggin River in Maine The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian Opies  the original people Dr Vernes wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children When they fly in they meet a man Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness They also meet Bethel Isely  the director of the paper mill who is to be their host He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies The latter have their own explanation Katahdin a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers Isely describes Katahdin as larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat As Isely drives the couple to their cabin their path is barred by a party of Opies They refuse to let Iselys people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso  one of Iselys heavies The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat The Opies relent and let the cars pass Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident While fishing Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck Later after he and Maggie have eaten his catch they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr Verne to put over their side of the story If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment Something is making the people ill still births mental illness and birth defects are rife Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector MRai  Ramonas grandfather Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as part of everything in Gods creation Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground Hawk nets a bullfrogsized tadpole from the water to show Verne Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity As they leave however Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggies boots It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap It will not show up in Iselys water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies That night the Nelson family who have set up a camp in the woods are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster The horrified Paul tries to flee but the beast spanks him into a rock killing him The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family Hawks however escapes Verne Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poachers net One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination However the weather has turned and the pilot Huntoon  refuses to take off in the high wind They make for Hectors home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hectors tepees and helps the cub survive Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub Isely is contrite knowing that Hawks and his men werent the killers Hector arrives Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hectors home All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him The next day the survivors make their way out of the forest The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beasts initial attack Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help Katahdin kills him as well The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit They arrive at the river and swim across The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first but then enters the water and vanishes They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges They take shelter in a log cabin but Katahdin tears down the walls Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdins hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws then he lands on the ground dead Verne picks up an arrow then Katahdin hoists him up only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror</td>\n",

              "0  Tracking two lost lumberjacks through the night, a rescue team nearly follows a hound over a cliff. Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, killed by a unknown thing. The third is then, killed by a unseen force Dr. Robert Verne  is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \"Opies\" , the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie  accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson  and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks  and Kelso , one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a broadaxe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident. While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested. The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona  approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai , Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \"part of everything in God's creation\". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue. Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by a ferocious monster. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast spanks him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim  arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon , refuses to take off in the high wind. They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. She tells him that their nightmare is just beginning: she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives. Then all hell breaks loose as the horribly mutated bear attacks the camp in search of her cubs. Everyone seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him. The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit. They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris but Ramona is crushed to death. Verne finds a Winchester Model 71 in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water. Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but the final scene reveals that there is another mutant animal awaiting to unleash its reign of terror.  ...

              "2  Dey plays Valerie Smith, a 17-year-old who is lured into participating in a robbery. Captured by the authorities, she is sent to a reformatory, where she finds herself in more and more trouble while trying to adjust. Her sentence multiplied, it appears Valerie may never leave state custody. Valerie becomes the target of unwanted sexual advances from some of the other inmates, until a young African-American lesbian named Tommy  takes her under her protection. Tommy ultimately sacrifices her life to save Valerie's.

              "3  Dr. David Lowell's  research is carried out in the canyon country of southern Utah and must be conducted at the same time Halley's Comet is passing over the earth. A corporation trying to find a remote place to illegally dump nuclear waste throws him off his land and destroys his laboratory. He spends the rest of the film committing ecotage against the company and trying to recover his land.

        "1)Από το παραπάνω κελί, μπορούμε να δούμε ότι τα δεδομένα που έχουν την μεγαλύτερη πιθανότητα να εμφανιστούν είναι τα Drama και τα Comedies. Αν ξανακοιτάξουμε το κελί όπου υπολογίζουμε τα clusters με τους περισσότερους νευρώνες, θα δούμε ότι το πρώτο είναι το Cluster 4, μετά το Cluster 2, μετά το 22, μετά το 8, και μετά ακολουθούν τα υπόλοιπα. Το Cluster 4, όπως βλέπουμε και παραπάνω, έχει κυρίαρχη κατηγορία το Comedy, η οποία είναι μία από τις πιο συχνές κατηγορίες του corpus μας.Στο Cluster 2, έχουμε κυρίαρχες κατηγορίες τα Action και Comedy, οι οποίες είναι και οι δύο πολύ συχνές κατηγορίες. Ομοίως στο Cluster 22, κυριαρχεί η κατηγορία Drama, η οποία είναι η πιο συχνή κατηγορία του corpus. Στο Cluster 8 κυριαρχεί η κατηγορία Horror, η οποία είναι στις 525, από τις 5000 ταινίες του corpus μας. Άρα μπορούμε να δούμε ότι επιβεβαιώνετε η ιδιότητα, ότι τα δεδομένα που έχουν περισσότερη πιθανότητα εμφάνισης στο χώρο εισόδου τείνουν να απεικονίζονται με περισσότερους νευρώνες."

Το Cluster 4, όπως είδαμε προηγουμένως, έχει κυρίαρχη κατηγορία το Comedy, ενώ το Cluster 6 έχει κυρίαρχη κατηγορία τα Thriller/Mysteries. Μπορούμε να καταλάβουμε ότι τα πρότυπα εισόδου θα είναι μακριά, λόγω του πολύ διαφορετικού σημασιολογικού περιεχομένου. Αν κοιτάξουμε και τον πίνακα με τα Clusters, θα δούμε ότι το Cluster 4 βρίσκεται μέση-αριστερά, ενώ το 6 βρίσκεται στην κάτω-δεξιά γωνία. Ομοιώς αν συγκρίνουμε το Cluster 10 με το 6. Το 10 έχει κυρίαρχη κατηγορία το Romance, άρα είναι λογικό να απεικονίζεται μακριά από το 6 (Horror). Αυτό επιβεβαιώνετε αφού το Cluster 10 βρίσκεται πάνω-αριστερά στο SOM, και το Cluster 6 βρίσκεται στην κάτω δεξιά γωνία."

Μπορούμε να κοιτάξουμε τα Clusters 3, 4 και 7, τα οποία είναι όλα δίπλα το ένα στο άλλο, στον χάρτη των clusters. To 3 έχει κυρίαρχα Comedy/Romance, το 4 Comedy/Drama, και το 7 Comedy/Short-Film. Άλλα είναι λογικό ότι μοιράζονται το χαρακτηριστικό του Comedy, γι'αυτό εμφανίζονται τόσο κοντά. Ομοίως, μπορούμε να δούμε τα Clusters 18 και 24, που έχουν ως κυρίαρχες κατηγορίες Family/Children και Family/Animation αντίστοιχα. Βρίσκονται και οι δύο δίπλα-δίπλα στον χάρτη (σχεδόν στο κέντρο του χάρτη), λογικό, αφού και τα δύο clusters μοιράζονται το χαρακτηριστικό των Family Movies, άρα θα έιναι κοντινά στην είσοδο."
