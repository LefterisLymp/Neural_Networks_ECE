Neural Networks course 2021-2022 assignments at ECE NTUA. In total, 3 projects were created.

✅ In <b>NN_1a.ipynb</b> and <b>NN_1b.ipynb</b>, various classification algorithms were implemented with the Grid Search method in [a UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Planning+Relax) and a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhakabartay/sloan-digital-sky-survey-dr16). <br>

✅ In <b>NN_2.ipynb</b>, a movie recommender systme was created, based on the content of the plot, using the [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) algorithm and [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding). Additionally, a topological mapping of the movies was created using a [SOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map). <br>

✅ In <b>NN_3.ipynb</b>, a CNN-based encoder and a RNN-based decoder were used for the task of image captioning.
